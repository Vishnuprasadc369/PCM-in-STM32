To extract raw audio data from a WAV file as an array of bytes, you can use Audacity to export the data, then read the raw file and convert it to a format suitable for your STM32 project. Here's a detailed process:

Extract Raw Audio Data Using Audacity
Install Audacity:

Download and install Audacity from audacityteam.org.
Open the Audio File:

Launch Audacity.
Go to File > Open and select your "Hello World" WAV file.
Convert to Mono (if needed):

If your audio file is stereo and you need a mono output, convert it by selecting Tracks > Mix > Mix Stereo Down to Mono.
Set the Sample Rate:

At the bottom left corner of the Audacity window, find the "Project Rate (Hz)" dropdown and set it to 8000 Hz. This ensures the sample rate is compatible with typical microcontroller playback scenarios.
Export as 8-bit PCM:

Go to File > Export > Export Audio.
In the "Save as type" dropdown, select Other uncompressed files.
Click Options and set:
Header to RAW (header-less).
Encoding to Unsigned 8-bit PCM.
Choose a filename and save location, then click Save.
The exported file is now a raw 8-bit PCM audio file with no header.

Reading Raw Data Using Python
To convert the raw file to an array of bytes, you can use Python. Hereâ€™s a Python script to read the raw file and print the array:

System Clock Configuration: Configures the system clock to use the HSE (High-Speed External) oscillator at 8 MHz.
GPIO Initialization: Sets up PA8 for PWM output.
TIM2 Initialization: Configures TIM2 with a prescaler of 0 and an auto-reload value of 999 to generate an interrupt at 8000 Hz.
TIM2 Interrupt Handler: Handles the TIM2 interrupt by updating the PWM duty cycle to the next audio sample.
Playback Functions: startPlayback() initializes and starts TIM1 for PWM and TIM2 for interrupts. stopPlayback() stops both timers and sets the PWM pin to low.
This setup ensures that TIM2 generates interrupts at an 8000 Hz rate, allowing you to handle audio sample playback in the HAL_TIM_PeriodElapsedCallback function. Make sure to replace the dummy_data with your actual audio data.
